# No-We-In-Food


## About The Project

This is project is based on Food 101 Dataset, publically available on Kaggle. The goal is to classify the images of the food into one of the 101 categories that are present in the dataset. However, since this is computationally very expensive to calculate, I have used a sub part of the dataset. Instead of using 101 classes, I have used 10 classes for this dataset. These classes are as follows

i) Chicken Curry

ii) Chicken Wings

iii) Fried Rice

iv) Grilled Salmon

v) Hamburger

vi) Ice Cream

vii) Pizza

viii) Ramen

ix) Steak

x) Sushi

The model used is Resnet50_V2 which is a transfer learning model and achieved a validation accuracy of close to 84%.
